  <p class="paragraphs">Welcome to the second page.</p>
  <p class="paragraphs">
    Every week there will be a new tutorial on a semi-random subject.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraphs">
    This week is a continuation of last week's tutorial on how to make a basic website.
    This week will be on how to make that website more elaborate and colorful.
    As you can see, some of the knowledge you're about to learn was used to make this page more vibrant.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraphs">
    To start with, lets work on elaboration. The first thing we'll add is a second page and a navigation bar.
    to start with, open your text editor and create a new file for your website. You can call it whatever you want, but
    for this tutorial, we'll call it "second page". Fill it out with the same basic template as last week's tutorial.
  </p>
  <div class="imgcontainer"><img src="file name.png" class="img" /></div>
  <p class="paragraphs">Now we'll make a navigation bar.
    A navigation bar is a strip that appears at the top of your website, and allows you to navigate to different pages
    of your website without having basic, ugly links like these:</p>
  <div class="imgcontainer"><img src="links.png" class="imgtype2" /></div>.
  <p class="paragraphs">
    To begin, open your "index.html" file in your text editor.
    In between the &lt;body&gt; tag and whatever comes after it, add the following code:
    <br>&lt;nav id="navbar"&gt;</br>
    &lt;div&gt;
    <br>&lt;a href="index.html" id="logo"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</br>
    &lt;/div&gt;
    <br>&lt;ul&gt;</br>
    &lt;li class="linkbox"&gt;&lt;a href="second page.html" class="linkanchor"&gt;second page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    <br>&lt;/ul&gt;</br>
    &lt;/nav&gt;
  <div class="imgcontainer"><img src="navbar shot.png" class="imgtype2" /></div>
  </p>
  <p class="paragraphs">
    This will create a navigation bar with a link to the home page and a link to the second page.
    Now, we'll explain what each of those tags does. the &lt;nav&gt; tag creates the space the navigation bar will
    occupy.
    The id="navbar" tag gives the navigation bar a unique identifier, which we can use to style it later.
    The &lt;div&gt; tag creates a container for the logo, which can be anything you want, but for this tutorial, we'll
    use the word "Home"
    as the logo. The logo is usually a link to the home page, so we use the &lt;a&gt;, called the anchor tag, to create
    a link to the home page. The &lt;a&gt; tag
    creates the link, and the href="index.html" tag specifies the link's destination. The text in between the
    &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tags is what is displayed on the screen.
    We also give the link an id="logo" tag, which we can use to style it later.
    The &lt;ul&gt; tag creates an unordered list, which is a list of items that are not numbered. We put the links to
    the non-home pages in this list to organize them.
    The class="nav" tag gives the list a class name, for styling purposes.
    The &lt;li&gt; tag creates a list item, in which the anchor element is placed.
    The &lt;a&gt; tag creates a link to the second page, and the href="second page.html" tag specifies the link's
    destination.
  </p>
  <div class="imgcontainer"><img src="basic bar.png" class="imgtype2"></div>
  <p class="paragraphs">
    This is the most basic incarnation of a navigation bar, and now we'll work on filling it out.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraphs">
    To style the navigation bar, open your "style.css" file in your text editor.
    In a blank line, add the following code: <br>#navbar {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    <br>width: var(viewport);</br>
    height: 1in;
    <br>background-color: rgb(0, 136, 255);</br>
    align-items: center;
    <br>list-style: none;</br>
    display: flex;}</br>
    <br>This will give the navigation bar properties explained here: the box-sizing: border-box; tag regulates how the
    bar is sized;
    the width: var(veiwport); tag make the bar as wide as the screen; the height:1in; tag make the bar one inch tall;
    the background-color: rgb(0, 136, 255); changes the background color to blue; the align-items: center; tag
    vertically centers the links in the bar; the display: flex; tag makes the links in the bar display
    horizontally; and the list-style: none; tag removes the list styling from the links in the bar.</br>
    Now we'll add some code to customize the logo link:<br>#logo { <br>font-size: 2em;</br>font-weight: bold;
    <br>text-decoration:none;</br> }</br>
    This will make the logo link larger and bolder than the other links.
  </p>
  <div class="imgcontainer"><img src="middle bar.png" class="img"></div>
  <p class="paragraphs">
    Now, we'll add some code to make the navigation bar responsive, so it looks good on all screen sizes.
    Add the following code to your "style.css" file:
    @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {<br>#navbar { <br>flex-direction: column;</br> }}</br>
    This will make the navigation bar stack vertically on smaller screens.
    I won't go into detail about how this works, but it uses a media query to apply the styles only when the screen
    width is 600 pixels or less,
    like if someone was viewing your website on a phone. Also, you're probably wondering why your navbar doesn't look
    like the one on this page.
    That's because we aren't done yet. We still need to add some more styles to make it look good. First off we'll make
    it stop looking like a list. Add add the following code to your "style.css" file:<br>.linkbox { <br>display:
    inline-block;</br>
    padding: 10px;
    <br>text-decoration: none;</br>
    font-size: 20px;
    <br>font-weight: bold;</br>
    text-align: right;
    <br>background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);</br>
    border-radius: 5px;
    <br>margin: 5px;</br>
    cursor: pointer; }</br>
    This will make the links look like buttons, and I'll explain what each of those tags does.
    The display: inline-block; tag makes the links display as blocks, so they can be styled like buttons.
    The padding: 10px; tag adds some space around the text in the links.
    The font-size: 20px; tag makes the text larger.
    The font-weight: bold; tag makes the text bolder.
    The background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); tag gives the links a white background.
    The border-radius: 5px; tag rounds the corners of the links.
    The margin: 5px; tag adds some space around the links.
    The cursor: pointer; tag changes the cursor to a pointer when hovering over the links, indicating that they are
    clickable. This one is particularly fun to play with, as you can change the cursor to all sorts of fun things.
    Next add this code: <br>.linkanchor { <br>color: rgb(79, 152, 247);</br>
    cursor:pointer;<br>text-decoration:none;</br>}</br>
    This sets the color of the text within the button to blue, the cursor when hovering over the text to the hand,
    and no underline on the text.
    You now have a fully functional navigation bar that looks good and is responsive.
    If you want to add more links, just copy and paste the &lt;li&gt; tag and change the href attribute to point to
    the new page. If you want to change the placing of the links, you can change the margin and padding
    attributes to adjust the spacing between the links.
