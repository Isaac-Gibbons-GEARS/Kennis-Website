    Every week there will be a new tutorial on a semi-random subject.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraphs">
    This week is a tutorial on how to make a website using HTML and CSS. First
    things first. You'll need to download a text editor. I recommend Visual
    Studio Code, but you can use any text editor you want. I tried using
    Windows Notepad, but had trouble doing the CSS. Once you have a text
    editor, create a new folder in the File explorer. You should probably name
    it something like "html" or "website", but whatever suits your fancy is
    fine. Once you have done this, go to Visual Studios Code and click the
    "new file" button. It will then ask you to name the file in the bar at the
    top. <img src="file_name.png" class="img" />
  </p>
  <p class="paragraphs">
    Upon hitting enter after typing the file name, it will ask you to save
    your new file.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraphs">
    <img src="file_save.png" class="img" /> Save it as "Index.html",
    and put it in your new folder.This will be the main page of your website.
    Next, you'll need to create a new file and save it as "style.css". This
    will be the stylesheet for your website. Now, open the "index.html" file
    in your text editor and type in an exclamation mark, then hit enter. This
    will create a basic template for your website. next we'll show you how to
    customize it.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraphs">
    The first thing you'll want to do is change the title of your website. To
    do this, look for the line that says
    "&lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;". Change "Document" to whatever you
    want your website to be called. This is what appears in the tab, like the
    "Help page" on this page's tab. Next, you'll want to change the body of
    your website. Look for the line that says &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;. This
    is where you'll put all the content of your website. You can put anything
    you want in here, but for now, let's just put a heading and a paragraph.
    To create a heading, type "&lt;h1&gt;My Website&lt;/h1&gt;". This will
    create a heading that says "My Website". To create a paragraph, type
    "&lt;p&gt;This is my website.&lt;/p&gt;". This will create a paragraph
    that says "This is my website". Now, let's add some style to our website.
    The first thing you'll need to do is link the stylesheet to the HTML.
    in between the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; tags, add the following
    line: &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;.
    This will link the stylesheet to the HTML. This will only work if your file is in the same folder as the HTML file.
    For instance, if your HTML file is in a folder called "website", and your CSS file is in a folder called "css", you
    would type href="css/style.css".
    If this doesn't work, try moving the CSS file to the same folder as the HTML file or using the master url.
    Example: If the html was in the html folder and the stylesheet was in the css folder in vs code,
    and they were both in the website folder, you would type href=website/css/style.css.
    Now, open the "style.css" file and type in the following code:
    body { <br>background-color: lightblue;</br> }
    This will change the background color of your website to light blue.
    You can also add color: ; and then type in the name of whatever color comes to mind in between the colon and
    semicolon.
    This will change the color of the text in the body.
    You'll notice that VS Code has suggestions for you. If you want to see the suggestions,
    just hit enter if it's what you want. These suggestions can be helpful for elaborating on your code.
    For instance, if you type in "body" and then hit enter, it will automatically add the curly braces for you.
    Or another example, when you start to type in the word color, you'll see all kinds of suggestions for specific
    coloring of items, like the background-color, or the color of the text.

  <p class="paragraphs">
    You can specify which html elements you want to change with css using one of 4 methods: 1. The id tag. This tag only applies to elements of this id. For instance,
    if I added a second paragraph, I could add the id="p1" tag to the first paragraph and the id="p2" tag to the second paragraph,
    and they would look like this: &lt;p id="p1"&gt;This is the first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; and &lt;p id="p2"&gt;This is the second paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;.
    Then, in the css, I could type in #p1 { <br>color: red;</br> } and it would only change the color of the first paragraph.
    2. The class tag. This tag applies to all elements of this class. For instance, if I added a class="p" tag to both paragraphs,
    I could type in .p { <br>color: red;</br> } and it would change the color of both paragraphs.
    3. The element tag. This tag applies to all elements of this type. Example: if I simply wanted to make all paragraph elements red,
    I would simply type in p { <br>color: red;</br> }. You can also use this to reference all of a specific elements inside of all of another specific element.
    For example, if I only wanted the h1 elements inside of only the body element to be red, I would type in body h1 { <br>color: red;</br> }.
    4. The universal tag. This tag applies to all elements. Example: if I wanted to make all elements red, I would type in * { <br>color: red;</br> }.
    This is the most powerful method, but also the most dangerous, as it can cause unintended consequences. These identifiers are always put in the first tag of an element,
    and are always put between the &lt;(item name) and &gt; tag.
